Notes:

1. You can have as many builds as you want. Youâ€™re not limited to 2 as in the example
2. The `<remoteBuildNumber>` element should contain the number of the latest build from the `<build>` list

##//TODO

Integrate XML schemas somehow (.xsd) and maybe create a tool which makes it easy to create and maintain changelog.xml
